    <h3>Workshop aim and purpose</h3>
    <p>
      This hands-on workshop introduces participants to the area-based
      approach for upscaling plot-level forest attributes using Airborne
      Laser Scanning (ALS). Participants will learn how to process ALS data,
      integrate field measurements, and generate wall-to-wall forest
      attribute maps for biomass and carbon assessment.

    <h3>Instructor Biography</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Cesar Alvites</strong> was born in Peru and holds a Ph.D. in
      Science, Technology, and Biotechnology for Sustainability from the
      University of Tuscia and the University of Molise, Italy. His research
      focuses on forest monitoring, forest ecology, silviculture, and the
      use of advanced remote sensing technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      He has extensive experience with terrestrial, airborne, and satellite-
      based LiDAR systems, integrating these data to study forest structure,
      biomass, and ecosystem dynamics. His work combines field investigation
      with geospatial analysis to support sustainable forest management,
      ecological research, and climate-related applications.
