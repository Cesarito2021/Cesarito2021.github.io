  <h2>About</h2>
  <p class="text">
    This site is a curated hub for <strong>R and Google Earth Engine (GEE)</strong> code,
    processing workflows, and companion materials supporting my research and teaching.
    The structure is designed to be simple to navigate and easy to extend over time.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    The teaching materials and workflows presented here aim to lower the barrier to entry
    for remote sensing and forest analytics, particularly for students and researchers
    working with LiDAR and cloud platforms such as Google Earth Engine. While independent,
    these resources are conceptually consistent with broader efforts to improve accessibility,
    reproducibility, and global collaboration in forest monitoring.

    <strong>OpenForest4D</strong>, which promotes web-based tools and educational resources
    to advance the monitoring and management of global forest ecosystems. The labs and code
    provided here share similar goals: supporting research, education, and reproducible workflows
    in forest science, ecosystem protection, carbon assessment, and hazard mitigation.
